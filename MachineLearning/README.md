# Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can identify patterns and make decisions based on input data. Rather than following fixed rules, ML models adapt and improve through experience, often using statistical techniques to analyze large datasets.

## Types

1. *Supervised Learning*: The model is trained on labeled data (data with correct answers). Common tasks are classification and regression.
    - *Regression* - Regression is used when the goal is to predict a continuous value (a real number) based on input data. Itâ€™s suited for tasks where the output is a quantity, rather than a category.
        - *Examples*:
            - Predicting house price
        - *Common Algorithms*:
            - Linear Regression
            - Polynomial Regression
            - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
            - Ridge and Lasso Regression
            - Neural Networks (for regression tasks)
    - *Classification* - Classification outputs discrete labels (e.g., "yes/no" or "cat/dog").
        - *Examples*:
            - Examples:
                - Spam detection: Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam."
                - Medical diagnosis: Identifying whether a tumor is "benign" or "malignant."
                - Image recognition: Classifying images as "cat," "dog," or "bird."
        - *Common Algorithm*:
            - Decision Trees
            - Logistic Regression (for binary classification)
            - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
            - Random Forests
            - Neural Networks
2. *Unsupervised Learning*: The model learns from unlabeled data, identifying hidden patterns or groupings (e.g., clustering).
3. *Reinforcement Learning*: The model learns by receiving rewards or penalties as it interacts with an environment, improving its strategy over time.
