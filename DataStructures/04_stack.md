# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack will be the first one removed. You can think of it like a stack of plates: the last plate added is on top, and itâ€™s the first one you would remove.

- Pop - O(1)
- Peek - O(1)
- IsEmpty - O(1)
- Size - O(1)
