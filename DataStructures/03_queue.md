# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This makes queues ideal for handling tasks in the order they arrive, similar to a line of people waiting for service at a counter.

## Big O notation

### Time complexity

- Enqueue - O(1)
- Dequeue - O(1)
- Peek - O(1)
- Size - O(1)
- IsEmpty - O(1)
